	<h2> Message to the Haters: </h2>
	<p> James Harden is one of the most hated and unappreciated stars in the NBA. Despite putting up Wilt like numbers throughout the 2018-2019 NBA season, many commentators stated anyone who took as many three pointers and free throws as him could put him the same numbers. I say if everyone could do it then they simply would. If you do not believe his style of play is visually appealing that is okay but please put some respect on his name.</p>
